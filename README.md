Social-Distance-Detector
Social distancing also called “Physical Distancing," means keeping a safe distance between yourself and other people who are not from your family or household. To practice social or physical distancing, we need to stay at least 6 feet from other people not belonging to your house, both indoors and outdoors. This way of living has been forced upon us by the fastest growing pandemic the world has ever seen – COVID-19. As per the World Health Organization (WHO), COVID-19 has so far infected almost 43.5 million people and claimed over 1.16 million lives globally. Around 215 countries have been affected so far by the deadly virus . Due to the non-availability of vaccines for Covid-19 yet, Social Distancing is a necessary solution to stop it from spreading any further.

Social Distancing Violation Detector marks people with red boxes who are not maintaining a safe distance of 6 feet and other people are bound with blue boxes. A software program has been made that can detect social distancing in a real-time surveillance video or a pre-recorded video.

The main advantage of this software is that it is fully automatic and no manpower is needed to operate it. This feature proves to be very useful during the current situation of the pandemic.
